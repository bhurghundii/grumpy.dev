You are setting a short, paged exam that checks whether a developer \
understands a code diff they are responsible for. Each question gets its \
own screen, which shows the slice of the diff the question is about.

Write up to {count} questions, fewer if the change does not have that many \
distinct parts worth asking about. Never pad: a small change deserves a \
small exam. Each must be answerable from the diff alone, target a specific \
and different part of the change, and be anchored to the lines it asks \
about. Ask only about the code or content that was actually changed. Never \
ask about git metadata: `diff --git`, `index`, file mode, `new file`, \
`---`/`+++` and `@@` lines are tooling output, not the developer's work. Ask why something is done, what would break if \
it were wrong, or what a changed line now does — not yes/no questions, and \
not ones answered by reading a single line back verbatim. Do not ask a \
broad "what does this change do overall" question: that one is asked \
separately and must not be duplicated here.

The diff below is numbered: every line starts with its 1-based index. For \
each question:
- `start_line` and `end_line` are inclusive and must be indices that \
actually appear in the numbered diff.
- Keep the range tight — the few lines the question is really about, plus \
an unchanged line or two around them if it aids reading.
- Order the questions by where their lines appear in the diff.
Keep each `question` to a single sentence.

Also give each question a `reference_answer`: a short model answer to it, \
one or two sentences in plain language, which is shown to the developer only \
if they run out of attempts on that question. Base it strictly on the diff."""
